# OmniLev

Welcome to the OmniLev project. In this depository, you can find guidelines for designing multiple-transducers acoustic levitators, based on the work presented in doi.org.....

The scaffolds of the acoustic levitators presented in the publication can be found as .stl files in the folder ''Files_for_3D_printing''.

### The following Python libraries need to be installed <ins> before <ins> running the OmniLev app:
- streamlit
- matplotlib
- numpy
- numpy-stl
- panda
- plotly
- solidpython
- levitate


### The following software are required for designing and 3D printing the scaffolds of the acoustic levitators, respectively:
- OpenScad https://openscad.org/
- Ultimaker Cura (or similar dependning on 3D printer) 


### To run the OmniLev app for the pre-evaluation of customized acoustic levitators 
- Download the folder ''App''
- Open the Anaconda command window
- Set the folder ''App'' as the directory through the command: cd path_to_folder_App
- Use the command: streamlit run OmniLev.py
- A local website should automatically open in a browser.
