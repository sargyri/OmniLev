The schaffold of the acoustic levitator Mk2 is split into 2 files: 
- Mk2_3pieces_bottom.stl
- Mk2_3pieces_bottom.stl
Additionally, two holders are provided within the files:
- Mk2_3pieces_base_holder.stl
- Mk2_3pieces_simple_side_holder.stl

To 3D print the designs you need to open the stl files in the software that is supported by the 3D printer you own. We used the software: Ultimaker Cura.
The schaffold and holders were designed through OpenScad. This is an opensource software that can be downloaded through: https://openscad.org/
