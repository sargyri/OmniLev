Two schaffolds of the acoustic levitator Mk2 are provided: 
- Mk2_half_2_pillars.stl
- Mk2_half_4_pillars.stl

The difference is in the way the upper and bottom halves of the levitator are connected. You need to choose which side support you would like your levitator to have and import the file twice in the 3D printing software.

To 3D print the designs you need to open the stl files in the software that is supported by the 3D printer you own. We used the software: Ultimaker Cura.
The schaffold and holders were designed through OpenScad. This is an opensource software that can be downloaded through: https://openscad.org/
