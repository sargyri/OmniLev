The schaffold of the acoustic levitator Mk1 with two side holders is found in the file: Mk1_half.stl

You need to import the file twice in the 3D printing software. You can attach the two halves with instant glue or tape.

To 3D print the designs you need to open the stl files in the software that is supported by the 3D printer you own. We used the software: Ultimaker Cura.
The schaffold and holders were designed through OpenScad. This is an opensource software that can be downloaded through: https://openscad.org/
